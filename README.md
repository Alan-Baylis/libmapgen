# libmapgen

Edit: This project never really got far and I no longer work on it.
It was part of my final uni project, but I no longer really have a good idea on how to make a useful map generation library.
That's why I went to work on map generation in OpenRA instead, as my final project.
You can see the progress for that [here](https://github.com/tmsbrg/OpenRA/tree/mapgeneration).
I'll leave the project here as an archive. You're free to use the code, the name or anything if you want.

C# library for to aid in procedural map generation, still very WIP. Everything subject to change.
