<p>C# library for procedural map generation</p>

<p>libmapgen is going to be a library that can be used to generate 2d tile-based maps procedurally, with ease. Using a series of passes, you can build a ruleset for generating a map by giving instructions like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>generate a heightmap using simplex algorithm at 20x20</li>
<li>simplify the heightmap to tiles of these types:

<ul>
<li>water (lowest 35%)</li>
<li>grass (36%-70%)</li>
<li>hills (71%-90%)</li>
<li>mountains (91%-100%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>generate trees on grass and hills at a frequency of 60%</li>
<li>generate rivers running from higher to lower places, in between the tiles</li>
<li>generate towns, more common at rivers and coasts</li>
<li>generate roads, made by pathfinding from town to town within a radius</li>
</ul>

<p>Something like that. Unity game engine integration is also being worked at on <a href="https://github.com/tmsbrg/Terrainstorm">Terrainstorm</a>. Initial implementation will be in C#, afterwards porting to C++ if there's enough time. libmapgen is part of my final school project.</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<pre>
using libmapgen;

Ruleset ruleset = new Ruleset(new RandomGenerator(10, 10, 0.0f, 1.0f)); // add initial generator
ruleset.passes.Add(new FlattenPass()); // add 1 or more map passes
MapArea map = ruleset.generate(); // generate map
// use MapArea here
</pre>
<h1>Status</h1>
<p>Basic generator/passes system is currently working. These generators are currently working:</p>
<ul>
    <li>RandomHeightmap (creates a map where every tile is a random height between a min and a max</li>
    <li>FlatHeightmap (creates a flat map)</li>
</ul>
<p>These passes are implemented:</p>
<ul>
    <li>DummyPass (does nothing)</li>
    <li>FlattenPass (flattens terrain below or above a certain threshold)</li>
</ul>
<p>Testing is currently badly done because I've been focusing more on functionality and I'll need to sit down to think about how I want it done a bit more. There's no guarantee of API stability at all, though the current structure seems like it could be a good one. I'll stabilize it some more when I have good results with this and <a href="https://github.com/tmsbrg/Terrainstorm">Terrainstorm</a>.</p>
<h1>Contributing</h1>
<p>The easiest way to contribute is to add a new IInitialGenerator or IMapPass.</p>
