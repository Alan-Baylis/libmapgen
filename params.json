Using a series of passes, you can build a ruleset for generating a map by giving instructions like so:\r\n - generate a heightmap using simplex algorithm at 20x20\r\n - simplify the heightmap to tiles of these types:\r\n    - water (lowest 35%)\r\n    - grass (36%-70%)\r\n    - hills (71%-90%)\r\n    - mountains (91%-100%)\r\n - generate trees on grass and hills at a frequency of 60%\r\n - generate rivers running from higher to lower places, in between the tiles\r\n - generate towns, more common at rivers and coasts\r\n - generate roads, made by pathfinding from town to town within a radius\r\n\r\nSomething like that. Unity game engine integration is also planned. Initial implementation will be in C#, afterwards porting to C++ if there's enough time. libmapgen is part of my final school project.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
